PCL for Mac
First of all, the pre-compiled binaries for Mac are only compitable for OSX 10.8 so if you don't have the latest version of OSX you are shit out of luck. I tried using MacPorts to compile the code from source into a OSX 10.7 compatible version following the tutorial offered on the PCL website but the installation process was tricky and prone to error and I'm pretty sure several parts of each code library were not installed correctly. Do this at your own risk and if you get PCL to work on a Mac with OSX 10.7 or below, email me at shkim93@gmail.com.

PCL for Linux
Compared to the Mac installation, the Linux installation was fairly easy. Just enter the instructions on the PCL website into terminal and it should automatically fetch all of the required software and dependencies for PCL to work. It appears the pre-compiled binaries for Linux are compatible with a variety of distros. I installed PCL on a Macbook Pro 8,1 dual booted with Ubuntu 12.04 and OSX 10.7 with little difficulty.

The tricky part is finding all of the sections of code that you just downloaded. Here are the following paths that I found contain the relevant parts to this project:

/usr/bin: contains all of the PCL included terminal commands (all prefixed by pcl) including but not limited to:
	pcl_pcd2ply: converts .pcd file to .ply (useful for importing 		point clouds into blender)
	pcl_openni_vewer: shows visual representation of kinect

For tutorials:
/usr/share/doc/libpcl-1.7-doc/doc/pcl-1.7/tutorials/sources: contains all of the tutorials and sample code for PCL.
	*I don't know what all the other libpcl* folders are for 		under /usr/share/doc
