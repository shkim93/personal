BodySim Scanning README

*Currently have not integrated steps. This is rough sketch of what needs to be
*done and it works

Step 1: On the command line, run ./kinectPCLviewer and press spacebar to capture
	point clouds from 4o clock, 8o clock and 12o clock positions. Manually
	rename point clouds as such.

Step 2: run ./filter <filtered_cloud> on each cloud. Enter parameters. We found
	that x = 1.3, y = 1.2 and z = 1 works well. Will save filtered cloud as
	filtered_cloud.pcd. Manually rename point cloud to whatever name
	desired.

Step 3: run ./main <cloud1> <cloud2> <cloud3>. Will show viewer of all three
	clouds.
